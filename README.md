# PUREFLOW

Pureflow is a mobile-first website that aims to promote authentic Ashtanga Yoga taught in the tradition of its founder Sri. K. Pattabhi Jois. This Indian yoga guru developed a unique flowing style of yoga known as Ashtanga vinyasa yoga, by which one links the breath and movement together to balance one's body, mind and spirit. The Pureflow website hopes to communicate the ultimate benefits of an Ashtanga yoga practice and the journey that one can experience towards a more present and grounded self. 

Pureflow is a website that will target first-time and experienced yogis and yoginis who are visiting or are located in Sanremo Italy. Pureflow will be useful for those who are looking to practice yoga in an authentic way, as how it is still taught in India today. Pureflow's goal is to create a community that connects to mother nature, who is our greatest teacher and inspiration to live a balanced life, to benefit ourselves and the world as a whole. Therefore, Pureflow will also be useful for those who are looking to connect with others for the greater good.

- **Landing Page Image**

    - The Landing section features a striking hero image of a woman performing a backbend yoga pose. The image's background displays a receding focal point encompassing the subject. The image was purposely chosen to convey Pureflow's website theme. Backbend poses are heart-opening poses on the spiritual level and Pureflow's goal is to invite self-discovery to connect to our true self on our yoga journey. The white walled receding background of the image portrays beautifully the purifying spiritual journey that one is invited to embark on. 
    - Besides the yoga image clearly communicating that Pureflow is a yoga site, the text overlay allows the user to immediately see the type of yoga that is being promoted and also the location the site is applicable to.
    - The image has a bottom primary color of a warm blue tone to help give the site hero image a warmer welcoming feel.

- **Journey Section**

    - The Journey section invites the user to start their yoga journey today, followed by the steps in the yoga journey process. As a first step, Pureflow invites and encourages the user to sign up for a free trial week, by using a large warmish tone yellow button that clearly stands out from its surroundings and gives a friendly inviting feel.
    - This section aims to communicate to the user what healing and enriching process one can expect from an Ashtanga yoga practice journey. 
    - The direction of the journey is signified by using an arrow icon that in ancient Hindu symbolizes physical strenght, perseverance, psychological prowess and concentration, which exactly describes what an Ashtanga practice embodies. The end of the journey is represented by a circle, which symbolizes union, the gift of being in balance with our true nature and living a life with more love and purpose.
    - The center image was chosen to encapsulate the journey's theme, as the Sahasrara symbol represents the opening of the spiritual self the way a lotus opens itself to the sun. By which the yellowish button above is perfectly complementary.

- **Intention Section**

    - The Intention section aims to communicate to the user the Pureflow yoga community's values by clearly stating three titles and sub-titles with further explanations and accompanying images. 
    - This transparent disclosure helps to present a distinct Pureflow brand, which is important to establish the user's trust.

    - The footer is of value to the user as it motivates the user to connect through social media and creates another low friction access point to Pureflow's community.

### Features Left to Implement

- **Teacher Bio Section**

    - A Teacher Bio section would be helpful to gain the user's trust before coming to practice. 
    - This section would display the teachers pictures and their names. Underneath there would be mention of their yoga qualification, their own yoga Journey and also which teachers they practiced under. Finally, there would be a description of their personal teaching style.

- **Gallery Section**

    - A Gallery section would display images of Pureflow members practicing yoga at the Studio. This would allow the user to have a clear idea of what the studio looks like and how people practice. The gallery would encourage more users to come to class, as it would take away any concerns or worries the user might have when starting a new yoga practice at an unfamiliar yoga studio. 
    - The Gallery section would also display images of the Pureflow community participating in past events and activities. This section would aid in reflecting the community values and goals of having a beneficial environmental and social impact in the larger community of Sanremo, Italy.
