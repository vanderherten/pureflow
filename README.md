# PUREFLOW

Pureflow is a mobile-first website that aims to promote authentic Ashtanga Yoga taught in the tradition of its founder Sri. K. Pattabhi Jois. This Indian yoga guru developed a unique flowing style of yoga known as Ashtanga vinyasa yoga, by which one links the breath and movement together to balance one's body, mind and spirit. The Pureflow website hopes to communicate the ultimate benefits of an Ashtanga yoga practice and the journey that one can experience towards a more present and grounded self. 

Pureflow is a website that will target first-time and experienced yogis and yoginis who are visiting or are located in Sanremo Italy. Pureflow will be useful for those who are looking to practice yoga in an authentic way, as how it is still taught in India today. Pureflow's goal is to create a community that connects to mother nature, who is our greatest teacher and inspiration to live a balanced life, to benefit ourselves and the world as a whole. Therefore, Pureflow will also be useful for those who are looking to connect with others for the greater good.
