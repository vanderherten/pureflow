# PUREFLOW

Pureflow is a mobile-first website that aims to promote authentic Ashtanga Yoga taught in the tradition of its founder Sri. K. Pattabhi Jois. This Indian yoga guru developed a unique flowing style of yoga known as Ashtanga vinyasa yoga, by which one links the breath and movement together to balance one's body, mind and spirit. The Pureflow website hopes to communicate the ultimate benefits of an Ashtanga yoga practice and the journey that one can experience towards a more present and grounded self. 

Pureflow is a website that will target first-time and experienced yogis and yoginis who are visiting or are located in Sanremo Italy. Pureflow will be useful for those who are looking to practice yoga in an authentic way, as how it is still taught in India today. Pureflow's goal is to create a community that connects to mother nature, who is our greatest teacher and inspiration to live a balanced life, to benefit ourselves and the world as a whole. Therefore, Pureflow will also be useful for those who are looking to connect with others for the greater good.

- **Landing Page Image**

    - The landing section features a striking hero image of a woman performing a backbend yoga pose. The image's background displays a receding focal point encompassing the subject. The image was purposely chosen to convey Pureflow's website theme. Backbend poses are heart-opening poses on the spiritual level and Pureflow's goal is to invite self-discovery to connect to our true self on our yoga journey. The white walled receding background of the image portrays beautifully the purifying spiritual journey that one is invited to embark on. 
    - Besides the yoga image clearly communicating that Pureflow is a yoga site, the text overlay allows the user to immediately see the type of yoga that is being promoted and also the location the site is applicable to.
    - The image has a bottom primary color of a warm blue tone to help give the site hero image a warmer welcoming feel.

- **Journey Section**

    - The Journey section invites the user to start their yoga journey today, followed by the steps in the yoga journey process. As a first step, Pureflow invites and encourages the user to sign up for a free trial week, by using a large warmish tone yellow button that clearly stands out from its surroundings and gives a friendly inviting feel.
    - This section aims to communicate to the user what healing and enriching process one can expect from an Ashtanga yoga practice journey. 
    - The direction of the journey is signified by using an arrow icon that in ancient Hindu symbolizes physical strenght, perseverance, psychological prowess and concentration, which exactly describes what an Ashtanga practice embodies. The end of the journey is represented by a circle, which symbolizes union, the gift of being in balance with our true nature and living a life with more love and purpose.
    - The center image was chosen to encapsulate the journey's theme, as the Sahasrara symbol represents the opening of the spiritual self the way a lotus opens itself to the sun. By which the yellowish button above is perfectly complementary.
